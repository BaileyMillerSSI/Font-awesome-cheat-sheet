# Font-awesome-cheat-sheet
A better looking cheat sheet as compared to the one on the official website. Will include searchable fonts, auto generated snippets, copy to clipboard support, offline experience with electron, and one day render to image.

## Electron App is going to be lit
Why run something in a web browser and deal with all the crap that comes along with it? Install a light-weight cheat sheet that can do so much more than a browser. Browsers are stupid so lets not deal with that crap. 

### Basic Features

* Creating a pretty looking searchable library of Font-Awesome content
    * Angular 4 does an amazing job with ngFor and makes searching very easy
* Code snippets are going to be generated in multiple formats for quick copy and paste 
    * One of the best features about electron is it runs on the local OS and allows access to the clipboard


### Future Features

* Generate SVG or PNG files from code snippets or icon search
    * Customize the color of the font awesome icon
* Generate snippets or images with multiple icons stacked
